## Using the Reports Tab

Browse and manage all generated reports:

### Features

- **Report List**: Shows all reports sorted by date (newest first)
- **Search**: Filter by ticker symbol or company name
- **Report Cards**: Each card shows:
  - Ticker symbol
  - Company name
  - Date/time generated
  - Type (Research or Reevaluation)

### Actions

Each report has three actions:

1. **Open**
   - Opens the report in your default markdown viewer
   - On macOS, typically opens in TextEdit or your preferred editor

2. **Reevaluate**
   - Opens the Research tab
   - Pre-loads the report for reevaluation
   - You can then update it with current information

3. **Chat**
   - Opens the Chat tab
   - Pre-loads the report as context
   - Start asking questions immediately

## Tips & Best Practices

### Research Reports

- **Use descriptive company names** for better context in the AI analysis
- **Reevaluate periodically** to keep reports current (e.g., quarterly)
- **Compare multiple reports** to see how analysis changes over time

### Chat Sessions

- **Load a report** for more contextual conversations
- **Ask specific questions** like:
  - "What are the key risks mentioned?"
  - "How does valuation compare to peers?"
  - "What's changed since this report?"
- **Use follow-up questions** - the AI maintains context

### Organization

- Reports are saved in `../reports/` directory
- Filename format: `research-{TICKER}-{TIMESTAMP}.md`
- Use the search feature to quickly find specific reports

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Tab Navigation**: Click tabs or use mouse
- **Enter**: Send message in Chat tab
- **Enter**: Submit form in Research tab

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start
- Ensure all dependencies are installed (Docker, Codex)
- Click "Check Again" in the dependency checker

### Docker Errors
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Try rebuilding the image: Dependency checker â†’ "Build Now"

### Research Taking Too Long
- This is normal! AI research can take 2-5 minutes
- Watch the output panel for progress
- The Docker container is working in isolation

### Chat Not Working
- Note: Chat requires the CLI to support non-interactive mode
- For now, use the CLI directly: `./scripts/docker-run.sh chat AAPL`

### Reports Not Loading
- Check that reports exist in `../reports/` directory
- Click "Refresh" button in Reports tab
- Verify file permissions

## Security Notes

- All operations run in Docker containers for isolation
- No data leaves your machine except OpenAI API calls
- Reports are stored locally in `../reports/`
- Docker provides sandboxed execution environment

## Getting Help

- Check the main README.md for CLI usage
- Review Docker logs in `../logs/` directory
- Inspect report files for detailed analysis
