## Checking Instructions:

### 1. **Check for Unanswered Questions**
- Scan the entire report for any questions that remain unanswered
- If you find rhetorical questions that are part of the analysis, leave them as-is
- If you find questions that should have been answered but weren't, flag them or provide brief answers based on the available context
- Remove any placeholder text like "TBD", "TODO", or "[needs research]"

### 2. **Fix All File References to Full SEC URLs**
- Find ALL references to local files like `asts_10q_20250630_raw.html:1149` or similar patterns
- For SEC filings (10-Q, 10-K, 8-K, etc.), replace the file reference with the full SEC EDGAR URL that is already listed in the Sources section
- The format should be: `(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/[CIK]/[ACCESSION]/[FILENAME])`
- Example: Replace `asts_10q_20250630_raw.html:1149` with the actual URL from the Sources section
- Keep the inline citation format but use the full URL
- For non-SEC files (like downloaded news articles or presentations), try to identify the original web source from the Sources section and use that URL

### 3. **Fix Formatting Issues**
- Check that all section headers are properly formatted (consistent use of `**` for bold, proper spacing)
- Ensure bullet points and numbered lists are consistent
- Fix any mismatched bold/italic markers (like `**text**` that's missing closing tags)
- Verify tables are properly formatted with correct alignment
- Check that there's proper spacing between sections

### 4. **Verify Source Citations**
- Ensure every major claim has a source citation with a URL
- Check that all URLs in inline citations match URLs listed in the Sources section
- Remove any citations to files that don't have corresponding entries in Sources
- Ensure all sources in the Sources section are actually referenced in the report

### 5. **Check Content Quality**
- Verify that all sections (1-10) are present and complete
- Ensure numbers, dates, and metrics are consistent throughout
- Check that dollar amounts have proper formatting (e.g., $1.5 billion, not $1.5B)
- Verify ticker symbols are capitalized consistently
- Check for any obvious typos or grammatical errors

### 6. **Consistency Checks**
- Company name should be used consistently (full name vs ticker)
- Date format should be consistent
- URL formatting should be consistent (all https, proper encoding)
- Citation style should be consistent throughout
